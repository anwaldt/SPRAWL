In the recent version, all access points send and receive two channels of audio to the server. Signals from the access points can be raouted to specific targets via OSC command. All access points receive the full binaural mix and selected sources. The server is per default configured for up to 16 access points, each with two channels: Acess Point | Sources --- | --- 0 | 0,1 1 | 2,3 2 | 4,5 ... | ... 15 | 30,31 Inputs and outputs of the SC Jack client are assigned as follows: OSC Messages Sending OSC messages can be tested with the PD patches control_position.pd and control_sends.pd .
